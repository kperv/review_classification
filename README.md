# Wine review classification

Machine learning project written on **Python** and **PyTorch**. Architecture is stacked CNN layers.
Data is Wine Reviews dataset from kaggle.com. https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

The goal of this project to build a ML learning from scratch. I have a couple of variations of this project with CNN + GloVe embeddings, RNN and LSTM.

Data analysis is provided in the *dataset_analysis* notebook. Data download, clean-up and split is provided in *dataset_preprocessing* module.
