# Wine review classification

Machine learning project written on **Python** and **PyTorch**. Architecture is stacked CNN layers.
Data is Wine Reviews dataset from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
Data analysis is provided in the *dataset_analysis* notebook. Data download, clean-up and split is implemented in the *dataset_preprocessing* module. 

The goal of this project was to build a ML learning model from scratch. I have a couple of advanced variations of this project with CNN + GloVe embedding and RNN:
